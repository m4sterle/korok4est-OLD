 Hi! I'm a former medical student who's currently navigating quite an unexpected and scary 'af (but also maybe a bit exciting?) plot twist in my career journey. 
 
 My story from the get-go begins with the cookie-cutter origin storyâ€”1st generation Vietnamese girl born to poor 'af Viet parents, strives for LARGE SUCCESS, studies hard, werks like a queen, achieves things like becoming salutatorian of her high school, OH and we can't forget the "me know me like _something_ about _science_; me know me hate other subjects", etc. You get da pointâ€”for most of my life, it's been a linear progression up in one direction. 

Surprisingly, I don't think I really knew my authentic and genuine answer to the notorious [[why-medicine.md|"why medicine?"]] question until after I started medical school. You see, throughout my time in medical school, I found out that I had secretly signed up to [[notes/game-of-clue.md|play one big never-ending game of clue]] for a living... AND I LOVED THAT! Who knew the act of clue-gathering and making your final accusation by the principles of clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis... would be _so much fun?!_

 In the most simplest terms, the job of a physician is to take a complex set of symptoms and systematically work through possibilities to reach a diagnosis. Like, at this point... every doctor should be carrying a magnifying glass along with their stethoscope, cause... **sis, you a DETECTIVE NOW.** (We all know [[Detective Le]] does...)

So YEAH, you could say that this was quite the period of discovery for me where this understanding of the intricacies of becoming a physician emerged. This only made my aspirations skyrocket, whether that be for [[major wins|better]] or for [[failure resume|worse]]

Pass forward a bit and then ENVISION ME IN THE TRENCHES. How did I get there and how did I get there _so fast?!_ This is an era that I've designated this [[digital-garden]] (aka the **korok4est**) to uproot and uncover for the rest of us. So.... tbd.

But listen, here's where it gets interesting - somewhere throughout this challenging period, the love I had for systematic thinking and medicine-related personal knowledge management that surrounds the related topics of the field of medicine as a whole field intersected with technology, coding, programming, etc., slightly nudging me in the direction of an unexpected path. The [[korok4est.md]] was initially just a way to document my medical knowledge and personal growth... and play with [[journal/pixel-art]]. But then somehow.... someway.... this project accidentally became my gateway into the tech world, introducing me to things like web development, the fediverse, and even the Gemini protocol!

What really excites me is how I can potentially combine my medical background (especially my love for breaking down clinical cases and differential diagnosis) with emerging technologies like AI. I'm particularly drawn to clinical decision support systems and ways to visualize clinical reasoning processes. Like, imagine creating interactive tools that help medical students learn differential diagnosis in a more engaging way! Or developing AI-assisted systems that support clinical decision-making while maintaining that crucial human element of medical judgment.

SOOOO.... what am I up to right this second? ***WHALE***, I'm at this interesting intersection point where I'm learning Python *(via this cute course called "The Legend of Python" on Codedex... um, excuse me but a 8bit-themed pixel art learning resource that references.... zelda???!!!? sign me up)*, exploring AI applications in healthcare, and trying to figure out how to leverage my medical background in this space. 

The best part? This journey feels less like leaving medicine behind and more like discovering  a new way to pursue my original goal of improving healthcare - just with a different set of tools than I initially imagined. Instead of treating patients directly, I'm could potentially create these bad ass tools that could help countless healthcare providers in their clinical reasoning processes. Maybe this alternate quest route will end up actually fitting [[Master Le|[Master Le|the master's character build]] better, who knows? ðŸŒ±âœ¨
